Changelog from 0.1.1 to 0.2

	General
		'Deconstructor' renamed to 'Lunar Deconstructor'
		Goodie bag is gone, now 'Lunar Cube', upgraded version is 'Queer Lunar Cube'.
		You can craft a Lunar Cube at the Lunar Deconstructor with 1 of any Lunar Fragment and 1 Lunar Bar.
		A 'Queer' Lunar Cube is crafted with 1 Lunar Cube and 1 of any Lunar Fragment at the Lunar Deconstructor.
		A Queer Lunar Cube can be sealed and unsealed without being destroyed, a Lunar Cube can be unsealed once before being destroyed.
		Queer Lunar Cubes are recognizable by their morphing colors.
		The cubes also have a overhauled tooltips and tooltip ordering (compared to the old goodie bag)
		While deconstruction UI is open, rightclicking a cube will not unseal it to prevent accidental openings.

	UI Changes
		There's now a new slot (top slot) which will take an unsealed cube, contents will be sealed into this cube
		The bottom slot is for the item you want to seal
		UI will now show reddit's 'Wow, such empty' doge when the list is empty, because the initial preview was posted on reddit
		UI item slots now supports ModItem Pre/Post DrawInInventory, along with a 'breathing' effect (such as lunar fragments)
		UI item slots stack drawing improved: now draws with black border (FourWay)

	Bugfixes
		Fixed several bugs, including but not limited to:
			1) Not receiving items when UI is forcefully closed
			2) Distance from tile to player not being managed properly
				This is fixed by shifting the logic completely to a TileEntity
			3) Right click not functioning properly on UI ItemSlots
				This includes loss of ItemInfos

	Sprite improvements
		Tile sprite was improved.
		Cube sprite was improved.
		Both cubes share the same sprite, but the Queer version morphs colors.
	
	Other
		Massive improvements/reworks in code, check github
		Vanilla 'flask' are now also seen as potions, and thus will have a failure rate in place.
		By changing the code to use ItemRarity.GetColor, the rarity for level 4 should now be properly displayed
		Added 2 more 'errors' in UI:
			1) When trying to seal an already sealed cube
			2) When trying to seal with no cube in the UI
		UI slots now show a faded texture along with a helper tooltip to help players figure out what they're for
