Changelog from 0.1.1 to 0.2

	General
		'Deconstructor' renamed to 'Lunar Deconstructor'
		Goodie bag is gone, now 'Lunar Cube', upgraded version is 'Queer Lunar Cube'
		You can craft a Lunar Cube at the Lunar Deconstructor with 1 of any Lunar Fragment and 1 Lunar Bar
		A 'Queer' Lunar Cube is crafted with 1 Lunar Cube and 1 of any Lunar Fragment at the Lunar Deconstructor
		A Queer Lunar Cube can be unsealed without being destroyed, a Lunar Cube is destroyed itself upon unsealing
		A Queer Lunar Cube is recognizable by its morphing colors
		The cubes also have a overhauled tooltips and tooltip ordering
		While deconstruction UI is open, right clicking a cube will not unseal it to prevent accidental openings
		Item loss chance changed to 30% (from 20%)
		Tile itself no longer draws cube all the time, instead it will draw the cube that's currently it its UI
		All SFX volume lowered by 50%, no more earrape guys
		Lunar Deconstructor now counts as a table for rooms
		Changed tile origin for easier placement
		Changed mod display name to 'Lunar Deconstructor'
		Changed deconstruction pricing ever so slightly (deconstructs with no value are now based off of total stack count)

	UI Changes
		There's now a new slot (top slot) which will take an unsealed cube, contents will be sealed into this cube
		The bottom slot is for the item you want to seal. Tooltips will show on mouse hover to help you.
		UI will now show reddit's 'Wow, such empty' doge when the list is empty, because the initial preview was posted on reddit
		UI item slots now supports ModItem Pre/Post DrawInInventory, along with a 'breathing' effect (lunar fragments 'breathe', for example)
		UI item slots stack drawing improved: now draws with black border (FourWay)

	Bugfixes
		Fixed several bugs, including but not limited to:
			1) Not receiving items when UI is forcefully closed in certain circumstances
			2) Distance from tile to player not being managed properly
				This is fixed by shifting the logic completely to the TileEntity
			3) Right click not functioning properly on UI ItemSlots
				This includes loss of ItemInfos
			4) Infos for cubes (previously goodie bags) not being synced in multiplayer
				Fixed using Netsend/Netreceive
			5) Certain vanilla layer not being drawn when your mouse hovers the deconstructor UI, even when it's invisible

	Sprite improvements
		Tile sprite was improved.
		Cube sprite was improved.
		Queer cube morphs in colors.
	
	Other
		Massive improvements/reworks in code, check github
		Vanilla 'flask' are now also seen as potions, and thus will have a failure rate in place
		Lunar fragments (solar, vortex, stardust, nebula) now also have a failure rate in place
		By changing the code to use ItemRarity.GetColor, the rarity color for level 4 should now be correct
		Added 2 more 'errors' in UI:
			1) When trying to seal an already sealed cube
			2) When trying to seal with no cube in the UI
		UI slots now show a faded texture along with a helper tooltip to help players figure out what they're for
