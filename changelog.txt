Changelog from 0.1.1 to 0.2

	Rename
		'Deconstructor' is now 'Lunar Deconstructor'
		Goodie bag is gone, now 'Lunar Cube', upgraded version now 'Queer Lunar Cube'

	New cubes!
		Lunar Deconstructor no longer 'zips' into a goodie bag, instead uses a Lunar Cube as resource
		'Queer Lunar' Cube is also available, which can be sealed and unsealed indefinitely (Lunar Cube is one time use, breaks upon unsealing)
		The cubes also have a overhauled tooltips and tooltip ordering

	UI
		There's now a new slot (top slot) which will take an unsealed cube, contents will be sealed into this cube
		The bottom slot is for the item you want to seal
	
	Improvements
		Massive improvements/reworks in code, check github
		Vanilla 'flask' are now also seen as potions, and thus will have a failure rate in place.

Todo:
	
	Manage distance to tile using TE and GUI instance
	Make sure UI can only be dragged when base panel is clicked
	Have cube/source panels show a feint silhouette of which item is supposed to be in it (possibly along with helper tooltips) [PARTIALLY DONE]
	Add recipes to craft cubes
