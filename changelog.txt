Changelog from 0.1.1 to 0.2

	Rename
		'Deconstructor' is now 'Lunar Deconstructor'

	New cubes!
		Lunar Deconstructor no longer 'zips' into a goodie bag, instead uses a Lunar Cube as resource
		'Queer Lunar' Cube is also available, which can be sealed and unsealed indefinitely (Lunar Cube is one time use)
		Overhauled tooltips for cubes

	UI
		There's now a new slot (top slot) which will take an unsealed cube, contents will be sealed into this cube
		The bottom slot is for the item you want to seal
	
	Code
		Massive improvements/reworks in code, check github

Todo:
	
	Make sure UI doesn't close when using Queer cube
	Make sure UI takes Queer cube as input when opened by Queer cube
	Make sure UI 'refunds' cube when one is in the panel
	Have cube/source panels show a feint silhouette of which item is supposed to be in it (possibly along with helper tooltips)
	Add recipes to craft cubes
